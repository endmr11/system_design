# Remote Configuration

Remote configuration and dynamic feature management is a powerful tool that allows you to control your application's behavior and features from the server side. This technology has become an indispensable part of modern mobile applications.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic Feature Management**: Ability to toggle application features from the server
- **A/B Testing Support**: Ability to provide different experiences to different user groups
- **Quick Updates**: Make changes without app store updates
- **Conditional Configuration**: Customized experiences based on user segmentation
- **Real-time Changes**: Instant updates and modifications
- **Multi-platform Support**: Consistent configuration across iOS, Android, and web platforms

## Use Cases

### 1. Feature Rollout
**Scenario**: Adding a new payment method to your e-commerce app.
- Initially shown to 5% of users
- Monitor error rates and user feedback
- Gradually roll out to all users if successful
- Instantly disable if issues arise

### 2. Emergency Management
**Scenario**: A critical security vulnerability is detected in your app.
- Immediately disable the affected feature
- Show notification to users
- Provide alternative flows until fixed

### 3. Regional Customization
**Scenario**: Offering different payment methods in different countries.
- Bank transfer options in Turkey
- Credit card focused payments in the US
- Bank transfer priority in Germany

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Scenario**: Improving application performance.
- Increase cache duration during peak hours
- Reduce image quality in low-bandwidth regions
- Adjust request frequency to balance server load

## Best Practices

### 1. Configuration Management
- Caching configuration values
- Defining default values
- Monitoring and logging changes
- Implementing security controls

### 2. Error Handling
- Using last known good configuration on connection loss
- Validating configuration values
- Maintaining user experience during errors

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Fetching configuration updates in background
- Preventing unnecessary updates
- Optimizing cache strategies

## Real-world Examples

### Netflix
- Different content catalogs for different countries
- Adjusting recommendation algorithms based on user behavior
- Gradual rollout of new features

### Spotify
- Regional pricing strategies
- Personalized user experience
- A/B testing of new features

### Uber
- Dynamic pricing settings
- Regional feature restrictions
- Emergency management and service disruptions

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Keys
```json
{
  "feature_flags": {
    "new_payment_method": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rollout_percentage": 25,
      "target_countries": ["TR", "US", "DE"]
    },
    "dark_mode": {
      "enabled": true,
      "default": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Code
```swift
// iOS example
RemoteConfig.shared.fetch { config in
    if config.isFeatureEnabled("new_payment_method") {
        // Show new payment method
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Android example
FirebaseRemoteConfig.getInstance().fetchAndActivate()
    .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            val isNewFeatureEnabled = remoteConfig.getBoolean("new_feature")
            // Manage feature
        }
    }
```
