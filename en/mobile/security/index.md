# Security & Access Control

Modern mobile applications handle sensitive user data, financial transactions, and personal information. Implementing robust security measures is not optionalâ€”it's a fundamental requirement. This section covers comprehensive security strategies, authentication patterns, and access control mechanisms for enterprise-level mobile applications.

## Security Architecture Overview

Mobile security operates across multiple layers:
- **Application Layer**: Code obfuscation, runtime protection
- **Data Layer**: Encryption, secure storage, key management
- **Network Layer**: TLS/SSL, certificate pinning, API security
- **Platform Layer**: OS-level security features, permissions
- **Device Layer**: Biometric authentication, hardware security modules

| **OWASP Mobile** | Cross-platform | Mobile application security testing guide |
| **NIST Cybersecurity** | Cross-platform | Comprehensive security framework |
| **PCI DSS** | Cross-platform | Payment card industry security standards |
| **GDPR** | Cross-platform | European data protection regulations |
| **CCPA** | Cross-platform | California consumer privacy act |

## Platform-Specific Security Features

### Android Security Features
- **Android Keystore**: Hardware-backed key storage
- **EncryptedSharedPreferences**: Secure data storage
- **Biometric API**: Unified biometric authentication
- **Network Security Config**: TLS configuration
- **App Signing**: APK integrity verification

### iOS Security Features

## Security Testing Strategy

### Static Analysis
- Code vulnerability scanning
- Dependency vulnerability assessment
- Hardcoded credential detection
- Permission analysis

### Dynamic Analysis
- Runtime application security testing
- Network traffic analysis
- Memory analysis
- Reverse engineering protection testing

### Penetration Testing
- Authentication bypass testing
- Data storage security testing
- Network communication testing
- Platform-specific vulnerability testing

## Security Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple security layers
2. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Minimal necessary permissions
4. **Secure by Design**: Security considerations from the beginning
5. **Regular Security Audits**: Continuous security assessment
6. **Incident Response Plan**: Prepared security incident handling

## Common Security Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| **Improper Platform Usage** | High | Follow platform security guidelines |
| **Insecure Data Storage** | High | Use secure storage APIs |
| **Insecure Communication** | High | Implement TLS and certificate pinning |
| **Insecure Authentication** | Critical | Multi-factor authentication |
| **Insufficient Cryptography** | High | Use proven cryptographic libraries |
| **Client Code Quality** | Medium | Code review and static analysis |

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Security
- Secure storage implementation
- Basic authentication patterns
